# Pattern Printing (DSA Foundation)

Why patterns?
- Master nested loops
- Understand boundary conditions
- Build base for arrays & matrices

Focus:
- Loop dependency
- Index-based logic
- Time & space complexity explanation

Key Rules:
- Rows → outer loop
- Columns / symbols → inner loop
- Boundaries control shape
